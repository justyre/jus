    # Red-Black Tree properties:
    # 1. Each node is red or black.
    # 2. Root is black.
    # 3. Each leaf (aka NIL) is black.
    # 4. If a node is red, then both of its children are black.
    # 5. For any node, all the simple paths from itself to a descendent leaf contains 
    #    the same number of black nodes.
    # 
    # By convention, we use NIL to denote leaves for the RBT, and they are always black.
    # 
    # Black height = # black nodes from a node to the leaves, excluding itself if it's 
    # black. All leaf nodes (ie NILs) have black height zero.
    # 
    # A red-black tree is a self-balancing BST and as a height of at most 2 * log(N+1) 
    # (For proof, cf. CLRS "Introduction to Algorithms" Lemma 13.1). Hence, for all the 
    # methods in this class (insert, search, delete, leftmost, rightmost, predecessor, 
    # successor), both the average and worst case time complexities are O(log N).
    #
    # Although maintaining RBT properties is complicated, its self-balancing ability 
    # makes RBTs perform better than ordinary BSTs.
