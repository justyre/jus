    # As a kind of self-balancing BST, all the methods of this class are O(log N).
    #
    # COMPARISON OF AVL TREE AGAINST RED-BLACK TREE
    # 
    # Since the red-black tree ensures that no path is twice longer than other paths, 
    # whereas the AVL tree guarantees that for any node, the heights of its left subtree
    # and its right subtree differ by at most one. 
    # Therefore, the AVL tree is more balanced than the red-black tree, ie shallower.
    # 
    # For search, the worst case takes O(h) (h is height of tree), so AVL is better.
    # For insertion, we first spend O(h) finding the place for insertin, and then do 
    # rotations that take O(1). AVL and red-black are the same.
    # For deletion, we first spend O(h) finding the place for deletion, and then do 
    # rotations. Whereas red-black tree takes O(1) (const) max number of rotations, 
    # AVL can take up to O(h) rotations. So red-black tree is better.
    # Both AVL and red-black trees have O(n) space usage. Although the color info bit 
    # is smaller than AVL's height info bit (an integer), for ints not too big, in 
    # Python, both types cost 28 bytes (which can be checked with sys.getsizeof()). 
    # However, in other languages, the size could be quite different. For example, in 
    # C++, color R or B can be stored as a char which is 1 byte (=8 bits), while height 
    # is an int that coests 4 bytes (=32 bits).
